Absolutely — let’s think of your portfolio like a **research lab’s website**, compact but layered: the visitor should immediately understand _who you are_, _what you do_, and _what you’ve built_, with easy access to code and technical insights.

Here’s a structured plan for your portfolio:

---

## **1. Home (Landing Page)**

**Purpose:** First impression. Quick, clear, professional + hint of curiosity.

**Content:**

- Your name and title: “Prashanth Vangari – Research Assistant & AI Engineer”
- One-line tagline: “Exploring 3D Computer Vision, Transformers, and Multimodal AI.”
- Quick intro: 2–3 sentences about your passion and current focus.
- Quick links/buttons: GitHub, LinkedIn, Email, CV.
- Optional: small GIF or image representing your main project (3D pose estimation, etc.).

---

## **2. About**

**Purpose:** Personal and professional background. Make it slightly human and research-oriented.

**Sections:**

- **Bio/Philosophy:** Your journey, research curiosity, approach to problem-solving.
- **Education:** MS in Computer Science, any relevant coursework, thesis/project if applicable.
- **Work Experience:** Concise bullet points on relevant jobs, internships, or research positions.
- **Optional Personal Note:** Your side experiments or fun projects that show curiosity.

## **3. Projects**

**Purpose:** Showcase technical skill, research ability, and code quality.

**Structure:**

- **Featured Projects (4–6):**

  - Each with a mini-card:

    - Title + short description (Problem → Approach → Results)
    - Tech stack: PyTorch, Transformers, 3D point clouds, etc.
    - GIFs/images if possible, link to repo, demo or paper if available.

- **Experimental / Learning Projects:**

  - Smaller projects, replications, prototypes.
  - Tag as “explorations” — shows curiosity and iterative learning.

**Optional sub-pages:**

- If a project is very large or has multiple experiments, it can have its **own sub-page** with detailed notebooks, plots, and insights.

---

## **4. Blog / Notes (Optional)**

**Purpose:** Share thoughts, mini-research notes, or tutorials.

- Short posts (1–2 per month) on experiments or literature you read.
- Example: “Comparing 3D Transformer Architectures for Human Pose Estimation”

---

## **5. Contact**

**Purpose:** Make it simple to reach you professionally.

**Content:**

- Email
- LinkedIn
- GitHub
- Optional CV download link
- Optional: short note like “I’m open to collaborations, research discussions, and ML engineering opportunities.”
